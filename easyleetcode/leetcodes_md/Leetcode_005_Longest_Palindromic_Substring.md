# L 005 Longest Palindromic Substring
 
--- 
 
```
Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S.
You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000,
and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.

Example
Given the string = "abcdzdcab", return "cdzdc".
Challenge
O(n2) time is acceptable. Can you do it in O(n) time.
