# SYL_1字符串_10Longest Common Substring

---

```
Given two strings, find the longest common substring.
Return the length of it.

Example
Given A="ABCD", B="CBCE", return 2.
Note
The characters in substring should occur continuously in original string.
This is different with subsequence.

求最长公共子串，注意「子串」和「子序列」的区别！简单考虑可以使用两根指针索引分别指向
两个字符串的当前遍历位置，若遇到相等的字符时则同时向后移动一位。
```
